## Changes in DataMiner 10.1.0 CU18

### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### Serial connections: Hostname resolution enhancements [ID_33702]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When a serial connection was configured with a hostname instead of an IP address, up to now, the hostname would be resolved when the port was initialized. When the hostname suddenly pointed to a different IP address, an element restart or a dynamic IP address change was needed for the serial connection to be aware of that change.

This has now been changed:

- In case of a TCP-oriented serial connection (serial SSL/TLS, SSH and serial TCP), the hostname will be resolved upon every connect.

- In case of a UDP-oriented serial connection (serial UDP), the hostname will be resolved prior to every send.

#### SLPort: Order of parameters in an HTTP session request will be identical to that in the protocol [ID_33796]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

In an HTTP session request, the order of the parameters will now always be identical to that in the protocol.

#### DVE function protocol version of active functions will now be deleted when the main DVE protocol version is deleted [ID_33834]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When a version of a DVE protocol with function DVE protocols is deleted from the system while functions are active, from now on, the function DVE protocol versions associated with those active functions will also be removed from the system.

#### SLLogCollector: Enhanced processing of SLProtocol memory dumps [ID_33932]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.0.0 [CU22]/10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, SLLogCollector is now better able to collect SLProtocol memory dumps, especially in cases where there is no reference to an element.

#### Enhanced error handling in case QActions fail due to a problem with SLScripting [ID_34010]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When an error occurs in SLScripting, from now on, a new SLScripting instance will be started and all QActions will be reloaded.

#### Parameter changes will now only be pushed from SLProtocol to SLElement when needed [ID_34047]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.0.0 [CU22]/10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

Up to now, parameter changes would always be pushed from SLProtocol to SLElement. From now, those changes will only be pushed from SLProtocol to SLElement when needed.

#### Size of the WebSocket messages sent from SLPort to SLProtocol will now be limited to 1024 packets [ID_34049]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

In order to prevent SLPort from running out of memory, from now on, the size of the WebSocket messages sent from SLPort to SLProtocol will be limited to 1024 packets.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector would become unresponsive when the name of the process or the path where the files had to be stored contained spaces [ID_33493]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

While collecting log information, SLLogCollector would become unresponsive when the name of the process or the path where the collected files had to be stored contained spaces.

#### Monitoring app: Trend graph of table column parameter not displayed when table row index contained forward slash [ID_33661]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.8 -->

In the Monitoring app, the trend graph of a table column parameter would not be displayed when the table row index contained a forward slash.

#### SLProtocol would leak memory leak each time a parameter of a replicated element was updated [ID_33745]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

SLProtocol would leak memory each time a parameter of a replicated element was updated.

#### Problem with SLElement when resolving foreign keys took a long time and the the element debug log level was equal to or higher than 1 [ID_33826]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.0.0 [CU22]/10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When the element debug log level was equal to or higher than 1, an error could occur in SLElement when resolving foreign keys took a long time. 

#### SNMPv3 credentials would incorrectly be checked when replicating an element with SNMPv3 connections [ID_33859]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you replicated an element with SNMPv3 connections, the SNMPv3 credentials of that element would incorrectly be checked. As a result, alarms like the following one would appear in the Alarm Console:

```txt
Load Element Failed: Error parsing SNMPv3 password for element: <element name>
```

#### SLProtocol could leak memory when the NT_UPDATE_PORTS_XML command was sent [ID_33891]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

In some cases, the SLProtocol process could leak memory when the NT_UPDATE_PORTS_XML command was sent.

#### Certain types of alarms could affect and degrade an SLA [ID_33899]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When an alarm of one the following types was generated, in some cases, that alarm could affect and degrade an SLA or be added to the list of active alarms for that SLA (i.e. enhanced service):

- Information Event
- Suggestion Event
- Error Alarm
- Notice Alarm

#### SLSNMPManager: StackOverflow exception while trying to resolve the next Request ID [ID_33901]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.0.0 [CU22]/10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

In some cases, SLSNMPManager could throw a StackOverflow exception while trying to resolve the next Request ID.

#### Problem with SLSNMPManager when an SNMP Get or Set was put on the queue while the element in question was being stopped [ID_34038]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.0.0 [CU22]/10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

In some rare cases, an error could occur in the SLSNMPManager process due to an SNMP Get or Set having been put on the queue while the element in question was being stopped.
